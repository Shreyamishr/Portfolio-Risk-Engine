# Portfolio Risk Management Engine

A full-stack application to manage financial assets and calculate portfolio risk using **Value at Risk (VaR)** and **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Asset Management**: Support for STOCKS, OPTIONS, and FUTURES.
- **Risk Engine**: Automated calculation of volatility and risk metrics.
- **Dashboard**: Professional UI with real-time portfolio summary.
- **Advanced Metrics**: Choose between Parametric VaR and Historical CVaR.

## 🛠 Architecture

The application follows a clean separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: React.js with Functional Components and Hooks. Styled with Premium Vanilla CSS and Framer Motion for animations.
- **Backend**: Node.js & Express. Logic is modularized into Controllers, Services, and Routes.
- **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose) for persistent asset storage.
- **Risk Service**: A dedicated service containerizes all financial logic, keeping the controllers lean.

## 📊 Financial Formulas

### 1. Volatility Calculation
We use annualized daily return standard deviation:
1.  **Daily Returns ($R_t$)**: $R_t = \frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}$
2.  **Standard Deviation ($\sigma$)**: calculated over the return series.
3.  **Annualized Volatility**: $\sigma_{annual} = \sigma_{daily} \times \sqrt{252}$

### 2. Value at Risk (VaR 95%) - 1 Year Horizon
Estimated maximum potential loss over a **1-year time horizon** with 95% confidence:
$VaR = 1.65 \times \sigma_{annual} \times MarketValue$

*Note: For Futures, Market Value is adjusted by leverage. For short positions, absolute exposure is used.*

### 3. Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) - 1 Year Horizon
Also known as Expected Shortfall, calculated using **Historical Simulation** and annualized for horizon consistency:
1.  Compute all historical daily returns ($R_t$).
2.  Sort returns in ascending order.
3.  Identify the worst 5% of returns.
4.  **CVaR** = Average of those worst 5% returns $\times \sqrt{252} \times MarketValue$.

## 📝 Assumptions & Limitations

- **Independence (No Correlation)**: Assets are assumed to be independent. **Total Portfolio Risk = $\sum$ Asset Risks**. In real markets, assets often move together (correlation). Professional systems use a **Covariance Matrix** to account for this.
- **Short Selling**: The engine handles negative quantities (shorting) by calculating risk based on total market exposure (absolute value).
- **Time Horizon**: Risk metrics are calculated on a **1-year horizon** using the $\sqrt{252}$ scaling factor.
- **Data Validation**: A minimum of 5 days of price history is required. Risk is calculated as 0 if data is insufficient.
- **Option Greeks**: For Options, we calculate risk based on historical price volatility rather than Delta/Gamma greeks.
- **Normal Distribution**: VaR assumes returns are normally distributed (Parametric approach).

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] **Covariance Matrix**: Incorporate asset correlations for more accurate portfolio-level risk.
- [ ] **Monte Carlo Simulation**: implement stochastic modeling for risk forecasting.
- [ ] **Real-time Data**: Integrate with Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance APIs for live pricing.
- [ ] **Authentication**: Secure user portfolios with JWT-based auth.
- [ ] **Dockerization**: Containerize services for easy deployment.
